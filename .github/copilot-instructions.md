This is a SvelteKit portfolio project using SCSS modules, BEM naming, and reusable components. Prioritize accessibility, SEO, and modern UI/UX patterns. Data is abstracted in /src/lib/data.js for easy updates. Use Svelte's built-in animations and SSR features. No Tailwind. Use Tabler Icons via SVG imports. Ready for Netlify/Vercel deployment.
